                <h1>Golf</h1>
                <p>Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.</p>
                <p>Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes, though recreational courses can be smaller, often having nine holes. Each hole on the course must contain a teeing ground to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 4+1⁄4 inches (11 cm) in diameter. There are other standard forms of terrain in between, such as the fairway, rough (long grass), bunkers (or "sand traps"), and various hazards (water, rocks) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement</p>
                <p>CGolf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as stroke play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team, known as match play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels, but most especially at the elite level.

                    The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland. The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764. Golf's first major, and the world's oldest tournament in existence, is The Open Championship, also known as the British Open, which was first played in 1860 at the Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland. This is one of the four major championships in men's professional golf, the other three being played in the United States: The Masters, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>While the modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland, the game's ancient origins are unclear and much debated.

            Some historians trace the sport back to the Roman game of paganica, in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball. One theory asserts that paganica spread throughout Europe as the Romans conquered most of the continent, during the first century BC, and eventually evolved into the modern game.
            
            Others cite chuiwan (捶丸; "chui" means striking and "wan" means small ball) as the progenitor, a Chinese game played between the eighth and fourteenth centuries. A Ming Dynasty scroll by the artist Youqiu dating back to 1368 entitled "The Autumn Banquet" shows a member of the Chinese Imperial court swinging what appears to be a golf club at a small ball with the aim of sinking it into a hole. The game is thought to have been introduced into Europe during the Middle Ages</p>
        <p>Another early game that resembled modern golf was known as cambuca in England and chambot in France. The Persian game chowkan is another possible ancient origin, albeit being more polo-like. In addition, kolven (a game involving a ball and curved bats) was played annually in Loenen, Netherlands, beginning in 1297, to commemorate the capture of the assassin of Floris V, a year earlier.
        </p>
        <p>The modern game originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is James II's banning of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery. James IV lifted the ban in 1502 when he became a golfer himself, with golf clubs first recorded in 1503–1504: "For golf clubbes and balles to the King that he playit with". To many golfers, the Old Course at St Andrews, a links course dating to before 1574, is considered to be a site of pilgrimage. In 1764, the standard 18-hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18 holes. Golf is documented as being played on Musselburgh Links, East Lothian, Scotland as early as 2 March 1672, which is certified as the oldest golf course in the world by Guinness World Records. The oldest surviving rules of golf were compiled in March 1744 for the Company of Gentlemen Golfers, later renamed The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, which was played at Leith, Scotland. The world's oldest golf tournament in existence, and golf's first major, is The Open Championship, which was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club, in Ayrshire, Scotland, with Scottish golfers winning the earliest majors. Two Scotsmen from Dunfermline, John Reid and Robert Lockhart, first demonstrated golf in the U.S. by setting up a hole in an orchard in 1888, with Reid setting up America's first golf club the same year, Saint Andrew's Golf Club in Yonkers, New York.</p>

                <h3>Rules Of Golf</h3>
                <p>The rules of golf are internationally standardised and are jointly governed by The R&A, spun off in 2004 from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (founded 1754), and the United States Golf Association (USGA). With the aim of simplifying the rules, in 2017 the USGA and R&A undertook a complete rewrite. The new rule book came into effect in January 2019.</p>
                <p>The underlying principle of the rules is fairness. As stated on the back cover of the official rule book:
                <blockquote>Play the ball as it lies, play the course as you find it, and if you cannot do either, do what is fair.</blockquote>
                There are strict regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers. Essentially, anybody who has ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction, or played golf for money, is not considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs. However, amateur golfers may receive expenses that comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non-cash prizes within the limits established by the Rules of Amateur Status.</p>
                <p>In addition to the officially printed rules, golfers also abide by a set of guidelines called golf etiquette. Etiquette guidelines cover matters such as safety, fairness, pace of play, and a player's obligation to contribute to the care of the course. Though there are no penalties for breach of etiquette rules, players generally follow the rules of golf etiquette in an effort to improve everyone's playing experience.</p>

                <h3>Penalties</h3>
                <p>Penalty strokes are incurred in certain situations and are counted towards a player's score as if there were extra swing(s) at the ball. Either one or two strokes are added for most rule infractions or for taking relief from various situations, with the "general penalty" defined as two-strokes, and disqualification for severe or repeated rule breaches. Examples include:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>A lost ball or a ball hit out of bounds (OB) results in a penalty of one stroke and distance (Rule 18.2).</li>
                    <li>With the exception of certain circumstances, a one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player causes their ball to move (Rule 9.4).</li><br>
                    <li>A one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player elects to take relief when their ball comes to rest within a red or yellow penalty area (Rule 17), or from an unplayable lie (Rule 19).</li>
                    <li>A two-stroke penalty is incurred for making a stroke at the wrong ball (Rule 6.3c).
                    </li><br>
                    <li>A two-stroke penalty is incurred for hitting a fellow player's ball if both balls lay on the green prior to the stroke (Rule 11.1a).</li>
                    <li>Disqualification can result from cheating, signing for a lower score, or failing to adhere to one or more rules that lead to improper play.[28]</li>

                <p>You can’t have a list of the most historically significant golf tournaments of all-time without including the first ever major championship.
                    <br>
                    On October 17, 1860 eight Scottish professional golfers gathered at Prestwick Golf Club to compete in the first Open Championship.
                    <br>
                    The eight professional played three rounds over Prestwick’s 12-hole layout. Willie Park Sr. won with a score of 174.
                    <br>
                    The win was two better than Old Tom Morris who had designed and essentially built Prestwick Golf Club with his bare hands just a few years earlier.
                    <br>
                    The following year the field was opened up to both professionals and amateurs, hence the name “The Open Championship.”
                    <br>
                    This was the first known organized tournament where both professionals and amateurs competed side-by-side for the same prize.
                    <br>
                    Between 1860 and 1870, players competed for a Champions Belt which the winner was allowed to keep in his possession until the following Open Championship. 
                    <br>
                    If a player was somehow able to win three consecutive Opens, he would be able to keep the belt forever.
                    <br>
                    When this idea was first implemented, no one really thought about the possibility of a player actually winning three consecutive Open Championships.
                    <br>
                    That’s exactly what happened in 1870.  Young Tom Morris won his third consecutive Open at Prestwick Golf Club. He was awarded lifetime possession of the Champions Belt.
                    <br>
                    The Open was not played the following year, partly due to the fact that they had nothing to compete for since Morris had taken the belt.
                    <br>
                    In 1872, The Open started up again and contestants competed for the Claret Jug, a prize they still play for today...along with a $1.3 million check.
                    <br>
                    Young Tom Morris captured his fourth and final Open Championship title that year.  He would die of a heart attack just three years later at the age of 24.</p>
